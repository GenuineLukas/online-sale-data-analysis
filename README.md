## Algorithms Used
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, type conversions, and feature engineering.
- **RFM Analysis:** Developed RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) indices for customer segmentation.
- **Clustering:** Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers, optimized using the elbow method and silhouette score.
- **Visualization:** Created various plots to visualize sales trends, customer behavior, and clustering results.

## Future Improvements
- **Advanced Modeling:** Implement additional clustering techniques like DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering for comparison.
- **Predictive Analysis:** Develop predictive models to forecast sales and customer behavior.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Create interactive dashboards using tools like Tableau or Power BI for dynamic data visualization.
- **Data Integration:** Integrate more datasets (e.g., marketing data, customer feedback) to enrich analysis and insights.

## Additional Features
- **Detailed Documentation:** Comprehensive Jupyter Notebooks detailing each step of the analysis.
- **Code Modularity:** Well-structured code with functions and classes for easy maintenance and scalability.
- **Version Control:** All project files are version-controlled using Git for tracking changes and collaboration.
